# CQAnalyzer - Code Quality Analyzer with 3D Visualization
# Implementation Plan and Roadmap

================================================================================
PROJECT OVERVIEW AND GOALS
================================================================================

CQAnalyzer is a sophisticated C-based tool designed to analyze codebase quality
metrics and present the results through interactive 3D visualizations. The tool
will compute various code quality metrics (cyclomatic complexity, maintainability
index, code duplication, etc.) and render them as 3D graphs, meshes, scatter
plots, and dependency visualizations.

Key Features:
- Multi-language code parsing and analysis
- Comprehensive code quality metric computation
- Interactive 3D visualization with user controls
- Modular, extensible architecture
- Performance optimizations for large codebases
